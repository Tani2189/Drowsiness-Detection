# Dataset:
for the above project here's the dataset: http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/eyedataset

# Dependances:
* tensorflow
* pygame
* numpy
* CV2

# Working:
* for the above model we used the concept of transfer learning for the model training.
* What does Transfer Learning do?
* The work of transfer learning is we will just use the knowlage of any model(eg:VGG16,InceptionX3,Xception,ResNet,etc) to train the existing model.
* By using transfer learning, we don't need to train by scratch.
* Architecture:
